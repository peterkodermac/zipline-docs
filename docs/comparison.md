It's 2021, stop using PHP.

## ShareX-Upload-Server

Its fine, yet the web app is slow, uses ejs ðŸ¤® and also uses expressjs ðŸ¤®. It's last few commits were last year and were merging pull requests from dependabot.

## ShareX-Custom-Upload

Again, it's 2021, stop using PHP.

## imageserve

Again, again, it's 2021, stop using PHP.

## ShareXen

Again, again, again, it's 2021, stop using PHP.

## share

Finally, one that isn't PHP. This is fine and all, but it limits you to mongodb, uses ejs ðŸ¤®, and also uses expressjs ðŸ¤®.


Thats most of the popular uploaders there. Most of them use php (why?) and the rest have a slow af web app.
